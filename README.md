Hello! Welcome to my profile, my name is Pyco and im 15 currently ([check when my birthday is here!](https://5xstkp.csb.app/)).

  

The site above that shows when my birthday is, is an example of a react project I made. It uses a useEffect and useReducer along with date management and conditional rendering to make it work and you can find the source code [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/birthday-timer-5xstkp) and if you find any bugs then please let me know! <span>üòÅ</span>
